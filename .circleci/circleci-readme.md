CI Debug Notes
================
To validate some circleci stuff, I was able to run a “build locally” using the steps below.
The local build runs in a docker container.

  * (Once) Install circleci client (`brew install circleci`)

  * Convert the “real” config.yml into a self contained (non-workspace) config via:

        circleci config process .circleci/config.yml > .circleci/local-config.yml

  * Run a local build with the following command:
          
        circleci local execute -c .circleci/local-config.yml --job 'github-maven-deploy/build-and-test'

    With the above command, operations that cannot occur during a local build will show an error like this:
     
      ```
      ... Error: FAILED with error not supported
      ```
    
      However, the build will proceed and can complete “successfully”, which allows you to verify scripts in your config, etc.
      
      If the build does complete successfully, you should see a happy yellow `Success!` message.

Miscellaneous
-------------

* Write Key setup

  To allow your CI build to push changes back to github (e.g. release tags, etc), you need to create
  a github **Deploy Key** with **write** access. The command below will create such a key. Use an empty password.
  See: [CircleCI-Add ssh key](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/add-ssh-key/#steps) for more details.
  
  1. Generate a new ssh key:
    
         ssh-keygen -m PEM -t rsa -b 4096 -C "community-group@sonatype.com" -f <project-name>_github_rsa.key
        
  2. Copy the public key to your clipboard:
  
         cat <project-name>_github_rsa.key.pub | pbcopy

     Paste the public key into a new **write** enabled **GitHub deploy key** with Title: `CircleCI Write <project name>`
    
     Be sure you check the "Allow write access" option. 
     Did I mention this key needs write access? (Don't ask how many times I forgot this).
  
  3. Copy the private key to your clipboard:  
        
         cat <project-name>_github_rsa.key | pbcopy        

     In the CircleCI Web UI, under Project Settings (top right gear) -> SSH Keys -> Additional SSH Keys -> Add SSH Key, 
     enter "Hostname": `github.com`
    
     Paste the private key.
        
     As a sanity check, the private key should end with `-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.
    
  4. Update the `ssh-fingerprints:` tag in your [config.yml](config.yml) to the fingerprint of the write key.
     This fingerprint is visible in the CircleCI web ui after you add the private key.
